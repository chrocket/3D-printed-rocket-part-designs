## Monocoptr
3D printed monocopter, two variations, a 24-mm motor mount for Estes D-impulse motors, and a 3x18mm motor mount for 3 Estes C6 motors

See the directions. Pay attention to gluing the wing into the base. This must be done with a good grade expoxy and needs to be very sturdy to handle the fast rotation speeds.
